  <h1>CSS3 Transitions</h1>

  <p>A Transition is a gradual change of value to a property during a set time, making the change smooth.</p>
  <p><b>transition:</b> shorthand to include all transition properties in the same line.
    <b>transition-delay:</b> Time to start the transition.<br>
    <b>transition-duration:</b> Time the transition will need to reach its ending.<br>
    <b>transition-property:</b> Choose which property is under transition for the element.<br>
    <b>transition-timing-function:</b> Behavior (speed curve) for the transition to obey.<br>
  </p>

  <p>The values in the shorthand <b>transition:</b> can be in any position. The delay time will be active only when
    there is a time for duration, even when duration is 0 seconds. The first time is always for duration, the second is
    always for delay.</p>
  <p>It is possible to set <b>different transition</b> behavior to each property; it is needed to <b>separate them with
      a comma</b>.</p>

  <div id="example1">
    <p><b>Trigger:</b> Hover<br>
      <b>Delay:</b> 0 seconds<br>
      <b>Duration:</b> 1 second<br>
      <b>Property:</b> width<br>
      <b>Timing function:</b> default</p>
  </div>

  <div id="example2">
    <p><b>Trigger:</b> Hover<br>
      <b>Delay:</b> 1 second<br>
      <b>Duration:</b> 2 seconds<br>
      <b>Property:</b> width and height size, background and font color<br>
      <b>Timing function:</b> linear</p>
  </div>

  <h3>SPEED CURVE</h3>
  <p>Hover over each element to see the different speed effect:</p>
  <table class="table_transition">
    <tr>
      <th>Speed</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ease</td>
      <td>Slow start, fast, slow end [Default]</td>
      <td>
        <div id="speed1"></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Linear</td>
      <td>Same speed from start to end</td>
      <td>
        <div id="speed2"></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ease in</td>
      <td>Slow start</td>
      <td>
        <div id="speed3"></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ease out</td>
      <td>Slow end</td>
      <td>
        <div id="speed4"></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ease in-out</td>
      <td>Slow start and end</td>
      <td>
        <div id="speed5"></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cubic Bezier</td>
      <td>Behavior based on the equation</td>
      <td>
        <div id="speed6"></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>













  <h3>Libraries</h3>

  <p> A library is a piece of code made to be re-used. Using libraries, someone doesn't need to create some part of the
    code, because anybody else has already created, tested, approved, and it works well. It saves development time
    letting the programmer to spend work and effort in other functionalities of the application in development.</p>

    <p>Both historically, and currently, a library is a collection of code relating to a specific task, or set of
      closely
      related tasks which operate at roughly the same level of abstraction. It generally lacks any purpose or intent of
      it's own, and is intended to be used by (consumed) and integrated with client code to assist client code in
      executing it's tasks.</p>
    <p>I think it's unanimous that a library is code already coded that you can use so as not to have to code it again.
      The code must be organized in a way that allows you to look up the functionality you want and use it from your own
      code.<br>
      Most programming languages come with standard libraries, especially some code that implements some kind of
      collection. This is always for the convenience that you don't have to code these things yourself. Similarly, most
      programming languages have construct to allow you to look up functionality from libraries, with things like
      dynamic
      linking, namespaces, etc.<br>
      So code that finds itself often needed to be re-used is great code to be put inside a library.</p>

    <p>A library is just a collection of class definitions. The reason behind is simply code reuse, i.e. get the code
      that
      has already been written by other developers. The classes and methods normally define specific operations in a
      domain specific area. For example, there are some libraries of mathematics which can let developer just call the
      function without redo the implementation of how an algorithm works.</p>
