  <h1>CSS3 Animations</h1>
  <p>An Animation is a gradual change from an initial style to another style. When an animation is finished, it changes
    back to its original style</p>

  <p><b>@keyframes:</b> Sets the instruction codes to run the animation. It works together with the <b>animation-name</b> property.
    <b>animation:</b> shorthand to include all animation properties in the same line.<br>
    <b>animation-delay:</b> Time to start the animation.<br>
    <b>animation-direction:</b> Specifies whether the animation will start from the first instruction (forward) or from the last (backwards). Can be alternate.<br>
    <b>animation-duration:</b> Time the animation will take to complete one cycle. Must be a value higher than zero; if it is equal to zero there will be no animation; the animation will jump to the end right after loading it.<br>
    <b>animation-fill-mode:</b> <br>
    <b>animation-iteration-count:</b> The amount of cycles the animation will run. Can be set to a <b></b>value or infinite</b>.<br>
    <b>animation-name:</b> Choose which animation will be tun to the element. It works together with the <b>@keyframes</b> property.<br>
    <b>animation-play-state:</b> Specify whether the animation is running or paused. Can be used together with hovering the element with the mouse.<br>
    <b>animation-timing-function:</b> Behavior (speed curve) for the animation to obey.<br>
  </p>

<h3>@KEYFRAMES</h3>
<p>It is the code to create the steps for the animation. It is similar to creating a function, but we are listing what will the animation accompplish.<br>After calling the <b>@keyframes</b> property comes the <b>name</b> for the animation. This name will be called inside the style declaration for an element.</p>
<p>The animation can be specified using <b>from</b> and <b>to</b>, having only two steps (0% and 100%). It is possible to specify the animation using percentage, then it's possible to have many steps in each animation.</p>

  <h3>Libraries</h3>

  <p>A library is a piece of code made to be re-used. Using libraries, someone doesn't need to create some part of the
    code, because anybody else has already created, tested, approved, and it works well. It saves development time
    letting the programmer to spend work and effort in other functionalities of the application in development.</p>

    <p>Both historically, and currently, a library is a collection of code relating to a specific task, or set of
      closely
      related tasks which operate at roughly the same level of abstraction. It generally lacks any purpose or intent of
      it's own, and is intended to be used by (consumed) and integrated with client code to assist client code in
      executing it's tasks.</p>
    <p>I think it's unanimous that a library is code already coded that you can use so as not to have to code it again.
      The code must be organized in a way that allows you to look up the functionality you want and use it from your own
      code.<br>
      Most programming languages come with standard libraries, especially some code that implements some kind of
      collection. This is always for the convenience that you don't have to code these things yourself. Similarly, most
      programming languages have construct to allow you to look up functionality from libraries, with things like
      dynamic
      linking, namespaces, etc.<br>
      So code that finds itself often needed to be re-used is great code to be put inside a library.</p>

    <p>A library is just a collection of class definitions. The reason behind is simply code reuse, i.e. get the code
      that
      has already been written by other developers. The classes and methods normally define specific operations in a
      domain specific area. For example, there are some libraries of mathematics which can let developer just call the
      function without redo the implementation of how an algorithm works.</p>
