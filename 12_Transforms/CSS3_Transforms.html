  <h3>Libraries</h3>

  <p> A library is a piece of code made to be re-used. Using libraries, someone doesn't need to create some part of the
    code, because anybody else has already created, tested, approved, and it works well. It saves development time
    letting the programmer to spend work and effort in other functionalities of the application in development.</p>

    <p>Both historically, and currently, a library is a collection of code relating to a specific task, or set of
      closely
      related tasks which operate at roughly the same level of abstraction. It generally lacks any purpose or intent of
      it's own, and is intended to be used by (consumed) and integrated with client code to assist client code in
      executing it's tasks.</p>
    <p>I think it's unanimous that a library is code already coded that you can use so as not to have to code it again.
      The code must be organized in a way that allows you to look up the functionality you want and use it from your own
      code.<br>
      Most programming languages come with standard libraries, especially some code that implements some kind of
      collection. This is always for the convenience that you don't have to code these things yourself. Similarly, most
      programming languages have construct to allow you to look up functionality from libraries, with things like
      dynamic
      linking, namespaces, etc.<br>
      So code that finds itself often needed to be re-used is great code to be put inside a library.</p>

    <p>A library is just a collection of class definitions. The reason behind is simply code reuse, i.e. get the code
      that
      has already been written by other developers. The classes and methods normally define specific operations in a
      domain specific area. For example, there are some libraries of mathematics which can let developer just call the
      function without redo the implementation of how an algorithm works.</p>
